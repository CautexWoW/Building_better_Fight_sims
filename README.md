# Building_better_Fight_sims
This tool extracts data from Warcraftlogs reports, and uses it to generate a Script to model that enounter in Simulationcraft
These scripts can be used in Simulationcraft or in Raidbots. 


To make this tool actually work, you will need to get your own WCL api key, then create a file named header.py that contains your bearer token. After that, feel free to cry at how badly everything is written. I am very new/bad at this.
If you see any code that actually seems smart, it was probably the idea of  @Demonslyr  or @benoitLemoine.
